											<h1>PERSONALITY TEST RESULTS</h1>

											<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Nashita Baig (s3899401)</h3>
											The personality tests are a way for myself to unpack myself as I usually do not have a clue about my personality and work ethic this also allows me to recognize my individual strengths and weaknesses. According to the results of the tests I have an introverted, intuitive and a compassionate personality, further I am classified as a visual learner when it comes to learning and developing and lastly my biggest factor in one of the tests was being an emotional stable individual. These tests are a way to confirm different traits and qualities and is similar to self-evaluation.
											<br><b><i><u>• 16Personalities</u></i></b>
											<br>In completion of the 16 personalities test the result is quite surprising to me as I am type INFJ-A, it is apparently the rarest personality and makes up 2% of the general population, the Myers-Briggs tests is a general test which bases of our individual lifestyle and identity and how we react to stimuli which would be beneficial for employers to see. I am intuitive, introverted and ‘feeling’ which comes under the category of compassion and caring, I am also apparently assertive when it comes to making decisions, which could be helpful in a group project as it also comes under the category of positiveness and bringing positivity in the group is always a good factor.
											<br><b><i><u>• Learning-style test</u></i></b>
											<br>For the second test, I assumed before starting the test that I am a visual learner just through past experiences and I was correct, this means that I learn better with images and demonstrations. Knowing peoples different learning styles could help the group support each other learn certain concepts.
											<br><b><i><u>• Psychometric Test</u></i></b>
											<br>The last test is a little difficult to decipher but has stated that my highest percentile was in emotional stability, which means that I am able to withstand during times of hardship and difficulty, which is again surprising to me. Having a high stability factor could mean I am able to be positive throughout the hardships we face throughout the group. In a team, those who have similar personalities are more likely to get along and work together, but similarly those with different personalities have different strengths and weaknesses that can benefit a group as well. The results may outline people's weaknesses and strengths such that some individuals may have a leadership quality which would be beneficial in a group.

											<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Sarah Khan (s3897667)</h3>
											These results indicate that I have an openness to experience, vibrant and intuitive. I am an In term of my behavior in a team I am more reserve but have a creative trait, feeling the need to connect with others, also tend to benefit from deadlines as it gives me a clearer idea on how to get the work done, in a team I might fall behind in trying to creatively come up with a solution to the problem but let others know of my opinion. When forming a team there should be a mix of people who are willing to cooperate in the team and give in all their thoughts.
											<br><b><i><u>• 16Personalities</u></i></b>
											<br>the 16 personalities test indicates that i am mostly introverted, where i am very imaginative, open- minded and curious. I am mostly prospecting and good at improvising and spotting opportunities, tending to be flexible and relaxed
											<br><b><i><u>• Learning-style test</u></i></b>
											<br>My learning style indicates that I am an auditory learner and can multitask and listen when others believe that I cannot hear. This is useful for situations where I can pay attention to details which can be of importance in situations in the workforce when being hold important information.
											<br><b><i><u>• Psychometric Test</u></i></b>
											<br>The psychometric test indicates that I have a low emotional stability, I have a really high level of agreeableness as well as intellect and imagination. My extroversion level is in the middle indicating that I am between outgoing and a shut in.
