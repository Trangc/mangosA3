											<h1>PERSONALITY TEST RESULTS</h1>

											<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Nashita Baig (s3899401)</h3>
											<p>The personality tests are a way for myself to unpack myself as I usually do not have a clue about my personality and work ethic this also allows me to recognize my individual strengths and weaknesses. According to the results of the tests I have an introverted, intuitive and a compassionate personality, further I am classified as a visual learner when it comes to learning and developing and lastly my biggest factor in one of the tests was being an emotional stable individual. These tests are a way to confirm different traits and qualities and is similar to self-evaluation.</p>
											<br><b><i><u>• 16Personalities</u></i></b>
											<br>In completion of the 16 personalities test the result is quite surprising to me as I am type INFJ-A, it is apparently the rarest personality and makes up 2% of the general population, the Myers-Briggs tests is a general test which bases of our individual lifestyle and identity and how we react to stimuli which would be beneficial for employers to see. I am intuitive, introverted and ‘feeling’ which comes under the category of compassion and caring, I am also apparently assertive when it comes to making decisions, which could be helpful in a group project as it also comes under the category of positiveness and bringing positivity in the group is always a good factor.
											<br><b><i><u>• Learning-style test</u></i></b>
											<br>For the second test, I assumed before starting the test that I am a visual learner just through past experiences and I was correct, this means that I learn better with images and demonstrations. Knowing peoples different learning styles could help the group support each other learn certain concepts.
											<br><b><i><u>• Psychometric Test</u></i></b>
											<br>The last test is a little difficult to decipher but has stated that my highest percentile was in emotional stability, which means that I am able to withstand during times of hardship and difficulty, which is again surprising to me. Having a high stability factor could mean I am able to be positive throughout the hardships we face throughout the group. In a team, those who have similar personalities are more likely to get along and work together, but similarly those with different personalities have different strengths and weaknesses that can benefit a group as well. The results may outline people's weaknesses and strengths such that some individuals may have a leadership quality which would be beneficial in a group.

											<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Sarah Khan (s3897667)</h3>
											<p>These results indicate that I have an openness to experience, vibrant and intuitive. I am an In term of my behavior in a team I am more reserve but have a creative trait, feeling the need to connect with others, also tend to benefit from deadlines as it gives me a clearer idea on how to get the work done, in a team I might fall behind in trying to creatively come up with a solution to the problem but let others know of my opinion. When forming a team there should be a mix of people who are willing to cooperate in the team and give in all their thoughts.</p>
											<br><b><i><u>• 16Personalities</u></i></b>
											<br>the 16 personalities test indicates that i am mostly introverted, where i am very imaginative, open- minded and curious. I am mostly prospecting and good at improvising and spotting opportunities, tending to be flexible and relaxed
											<br><b><i><u>• Learning-style test</u></i></b>
											<br>My learning style indicates that I am an auditory learner and can multitask and listen when others believe that I cannot hear. This is useful for situations where I can pay attention to details which can be of importance in situations in the workforce when being hold important information.
											<br><b><i><u>• Psychometric Test</u></i></b>
											<br>The psychometric test indicates that I have a low emotional stability, I have a really high level of agreeableness as well as intellect and imagination. My extroversion level is in the middle indicating that I am between outgoing and a shut in.
											<p>__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
											<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Lam Zhi Wei (s3846763)</h3>
											<p>Knowing and understanding these results help in a sense that it assists the group in deciding what kind of approach they must do in order to make use of me as a unit within the group. Overall, these three tests have suggested these few things about what I should do and what others should take note about:
												<br>I should make a schedule or deadlines or milestones to ensure I am not procrastinating.
												<br>Speak up. Because I can think and innovate, I should try to contribute as often.
												<br>Communicate. Try to understand others and listen to them. Explain via showing, not telling. </p>
											<br><b><i><u>• 16Personalities</u></i></b>
											<br>My MBTI test came out with an INTP-T, a logician.
											<br>This test labels me as an introverted, intuitive on-the-spot thinker that enjoys pattern and problem solving. And at the same time, could not, for the life of me, understand human emotions. It also signifies that I am a perfectionist that likes to second guess myself, often using others to debate with oneself in the head.
											<br><b><i><u>• Learning-style test</u></i></b>
											<br>My learning style suggests that I’m a Visual-Tactile Learner; the type to observe and use my hands.
											<br>It means that I prefer imagery and image-based learning, and at the same time, experimenting and building things in order to learn. To learn better, it is better for me to use flash cards, investigate what I’ve learnt with my own hands, and ensure I have plenty of breaks due to how easily bored I can be if I were to just listen. I wouldn’t understand quickly either if it were just only auditory.
											<br>The psychometric test indicates that I have a low emotional stability, I have a really high level of agreeableness as well as intellect and imagination. My extroversion level is in the middle indicating that I am between outgoing and a shut in.
											<br><b><i><u>• The Big Five</u></i></b>
											<br>In the big five personality test, my results suggest that I am introverted, prone to negative emotions, friendly, impulsive, disorganized, and an imaginative person.
