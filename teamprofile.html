							<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Nashita Baig (s3899401)</h3>
							<p>Hello, I am Nashita pronounced (Na-she-ta)! My student number is s3899401 and if need me you can contact me at s3899401@student.rmit.edu.au !
								I identify as a South-Indian Australian Muslim who is born and raised in Australia, my mother tongue is Urdu/Hindi and I have successfully
								completed my secondary education in the year of 2020. A small fact about me is that my name means full of life and energetic, and whether
								I am just that is for you to decide. I am excited to be part of the group Mango in the second Assessment of this.</p>


								<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Lam Zhi Wei (s3846763)</h3>
								<p>My name is Lam Zhi Wei, and I am a Malaysian Chinese born in Malaysia currently studying in RMIT, Melbourne.
									My hobbies vary, but I like to draw and play games such as APEX legends.  My experience with IT isn’t vast,
									but I’ve attended a computer science class as an elective. This was also the time where my IT interest started,
									as python and the world of information technology was introduced to me. The group name, Mango was chosen because
									we all liked the fruit. I look forward to working in it. </p>
