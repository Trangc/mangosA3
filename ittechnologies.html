							<br><b><u>What does it do?</u></b>
							<p>Machine learning is a method in which machines automate decision making and create predictions through data analysis. (SAS, n.d.; Heath, 2020) </p>
							<p>With the increasing storage size and lower cost of data storage in the modern era, it is now possible to store as much data as possible, consisting of several types and categories. The ever-growing development of data storage allows machines to learn using large amounts of data, aiming to create a certain accuracy in the machine’s predictions to prevent unwanted risks. (SAS, n.d.) </p>
							<p>Machine learning is applied within the society in many ways that require risk assessments and accurate insights from a large database. In healthcare, patient data is analyzed for a faster and more accurate diagnosis. Professionals could use machine learning to identify health risks and make predictions for future heart attack, allowing for action against fatal heart attacks. In the marketing scene, companies can gain insight on customer needs for better advertisement and product recommendations. Companies could also find frauds and identify at risk profiles, the same for governments where machine learning is used to identify identity frauds. (SAS, n.d.) </p>
							<p>Despite the benefits weighting over the risks, machine learning still has plenty of flaws that professionals are trying to solve. Such flaws include biased data checking, error prevention, and increasing the accuracy of machine decision making within human interest. Because of the nature of machine learning, a potential bias in the data could cause a major error in accuracy, causing errors in predictions and decision making by the machine. Moreover, machines do not have the same moral principle and interests as humans do, thus, decisions made through machine learning may not be in the best interest of its creator if not programmed otherwise. Although some experts believe that machines can be taught morality, others do not. (proviti, n.d.) Regardless, with the future in mind, it is likely that these developments may happen, creating a society where AI (Artificial Intelligence) is to replace human labor with increased efficiency and accuracy.</p>
							<br>The current most recent development -- deep learning -- is a new learning branch where the machine is to learn through a layered network like the human neural network. This development involves having neurons represented as layers that check a part of a data individually before handing it to the next layer to produce a result or conclusion. This method has proven itself to be effective, as it could recognize scenarios better than humans could, and could even be used to identify cancer cell indicators and tumor indicators in MRI (medical research institutes). (Copeland, 2016) A more notable achievement of this new method, however, was its ability to analyze and predict climate change data. (ScienceDaily, 2020) With the issue of climate change surging within modern society, this recent breakthrough of being able to help in renewable studies allows for faster and more accurate completion, affecting society’s energy resource management, transportation, and agriculture without needing much data storage and computing resources.
							<h3><b>What is the likely impact?</b><h3>
							<p>Machine learning is a highly valuable and beneficial tool to the productivity of society, impacting several fields such as healthcare, finance, and governmental affairs. Society would be able to form better solutions to otherwise unsolvable problems, and businesses could crater consumers even more, allowing for better customization and personalization and thus, better economics. Governments will be able to detect crime more accurately and make better management decisions, while research in health and services would advance faster, better, and even more efficiently.</p>
							<p>Although not all jobs will be diminished because of it, there will be fewer and fewer job opportunities for individuals who are not specialized in artificial intelligent or computer related fields. It will, as shown in the current era, replace redundant jobs that are currently active. For example, marketing teams may not be needed anymore since machine learning is able to detect what is best for their customers, and nurses will no longer need to help doctors analyze and gather patient data, as machine learning could do it even more accurately than them.</p>
							<p>The current discussion on whether the data held for machine learning should be handed by an entity or not, has raised a potential impact in the development of data transparency and security. (proviti, n.d.) The discussion speaks of how if the data is held by one entity such as the government, the machine could be manipulated to only benefit the entity itself but not others, while if it is held by everyone, the trust and privacy between corporate deals and their customers would no longer exist. </p>
							<h3><b>How will this affect me?</b><h3>
								<p>For me, it will perhaps be beneficial because I study in the IT field. Although there is no guarantee that I will encounter anything related to machine learning, there is a high chance that I would have to learn how to develop machine learning as well for the company I would work for in the future. What will be very different for me in the future, however, would be the speed of how everything is processed, and how fast service is expected. Currently, education and work are forced to meet demands with adequate speed and efficiency. With how much faster society would be in the future, humans, or workers would have to work way more to make up to the time machines could. Despite initially stating that it would be beneficial for me, I was referring to when I get a job. With this line of thought, it would be much more difficult to find jobs for me if I cannot prove myself to be a better, and more efficient choice between other candidates for a job.</p>
								<p>Daily life wise, it would allow me to go through my day faster, reducing as much redundant and unnecessary work I have. I would also get better services, serving my needs better and solving any issues I have in a short period of time. This should apply to my family members and friends as well.</p>

							<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Cybersecurity: Nashita Baig</h3>
							<h3><b>What does it do?</b><h3>
								<p>Cybersecurity is a specialized field in the Information Technology industry which is aimed at protecting systems such as networks, servers, devices and data from cyber threats. The cyber threats can range from thefts, illegal activity, information disclosure, data leaks and other attacks which negatively affect and disrupt the service or software. These attacks can be done in a bid to access valuable information such as personal data, steal money or make a political opinion and can vary in different ways. In the pandemic period alone, cybercrime has climbed up 600% and there is an attack every 39 seconds which demonstrates the extent of the issue. Cybersecurity is itself a large field and can take of many forms and is often difficult to maintain with the new malwares and viruses created and being applied in unexpected ways. Every year, we become more dependent on technology and are shifting into a technological era where simple tasks such as transactions and services are taken online which makes us more prone to having cyberattacks. Cybersecurity having started and explored in the early 1970s aims to protect the technology we interact with by building technologies that defend against the attacks by thinking and acting in line of the hacker themselves.</p>
								<p>To combat threats in the field of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence is rising in prominence with businesses and corporations relying on authentication to make sure there are no threats, the artificial intelligence is also able to deep learn certain data to filter out and identify certain threats. Behavioral analytics is also being used especially in social media formats to help identify patterns which can detect attacks. There is also technology unveiled to defend physical devices called embedded hardware authentication which are small chips or other hardware better than software-based which makes it difficult for hackers or malware to attach themselves. Block chain security is another method on the rise which is a chain of digital blocks of data (such as a transaction), the data is encrypted and is difficult to change and hack into as the data is stored collectively together and in order to change one block all the other links should be altered making it difficult to hack without notifying services. Finally the last cybersecurity practice is called the Zero-trust Model which means that the system or the service is already hacked and under threat when the network/system is shared, it causes companies and corporations to have a clear view of data flow and control of the data to protect from internal and external threats. This results in everyone have an identifiable verification login when accessing the sensitive information to ensure there is no threats from either those who are trusted and those who aren’t. </p>
								<p>The scope of cybersecurity is constantly growing with the demand of security services rising in a bid to defend against cyber-attacks. In 2021 alone the world is expected to have a cyber threat every 11 seconds (Germain, 2021), major corporations and businesses are said to increase their security with incorporating AI, machine learning, embedded hardware authentication, blockchain and the zero-trust model. In the next couple of years specifically we can see biometrics, AI and the convergence of 5G networks come together to tackle the issue of cybercrime. Inventions and breakthroughs such as intel’s sixth-generation v-pro chips make cybersecurity possible which uses multi factor authentication to make sure hardware is safe and protected. It uses Bluetooth and user control to verify an individual and also uses a scrambled keyboard to help make sure passwords are not copied. The future of the intel chips also lies in “logical location” (Hachman, 2016) which relies on trusted WIFI networks being connected to the device. These new software’s and hardware’s ensure that the prospect of security will be advanced in the future.</p>
							<h3><b>What is the likely impact?</b><h3>
								<p>Cybersecurity will positively affect the global scale with many job offerings being opened to hire cybersecurity specialists and experts. By 2029, 31% of cybersecurity jobs will grow which ensures the stability of the industry especially as the new technological era takes over. The significance of cyber security is highly noticed now where companies and big corporations investing in cybersecurity to stop them from being vulnerable to hackers. Over the course of the years, we will see major companies aim to provide security to other small industries with the cybersecurity department becoming a business. </p>
								<p>Cybersecurity will be further explored and invested upon as new coming of the age malwares and viruses simultaneously will be released to threaten the technological ecosystem. Cybersecurity is likely to impact the society with more people being aware of the dangers of putting personal information online and leaving digital footprints which can cater the way of attacks, this would make people take measures to ensure their information isn’t compromised such as investing in new technology. If cybersecurity is not acted on and developed further major companies will see consumer loss as people will be reluctant to trust them, followed by large economic costs which can disrupt services around the world. Further with cybercrime increasing there is a possibility that online freedom will be restricted with governments and corporations fighting against crimes.  </p>
						
							<h3><b>How will this affect me?</b><h3>
								<p>With the risks of being cyber attacked, I will be conscious of my digital footprint online in the future, I would want to educate my family and friends of the dangers of cybercrime and how we are all equally susceptible to the doings of criminals online. I would want more funds to be funded in the field of cybersecurity for the experts and professionals to research and design/create innovations that will help me and my family be safe from any kind of threats. Cyber security will make certain platforms safer to use and sequentially I would be more comfortable using those apps. It is incredibly easy to put things up on social media without realizing certain stuff may be the gateway to an attack, for example there have been many fake instances where people disguise themselves as another individual and try to secure security questions which risks sensitive information.</p>
								<p>An aspect to how cybersecurity will specifically affect me is that I would like to look further into cybersecurity as a job prospect as it is becoming a stable domain in the IT industry. Further, cybersecurity will change how I view the world now, everything is in risk of getting compromised and it is incredibly easy for someone to access my information just by joining a public WIFI network. Especially with the development of other technologies such as robots, it is interesting to know how easy a robot can be hacked over a cellular network which would make me uncertain to trust certain AI developments. But with the high development of Cybersecurity, I would be more relaxed to trust these developments in my daily life and it would also make me safer on the internet and on different platforms.</p>

							<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Clouds, services, servers: Sarah Khan</h3>
							<h3><b>What does it do?</b><h3>
								<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services. This also involves databases, storage, servers, networking and analytics. It is a big shift from traditional IT resource in which it can be accessed remotely. Several servers are linked together to share the load this enables complex processes to be distributed across multiple smaller computers. Cloud computing held up the world's economy, remote workforces and global supply chains during the covid-19 pandemic. To this very day its effect lingers through businesses and workforces.  “The effects of COVID-19 will linger throughout 2021, as businesses will look to lay a foundation for increased agility,” said Dustin Milberg, field chief technology officer for cloud services at InterVision. Cloud services allow user data to facilitate the flow from front-end clients through the internet, to the providers systems and back. Cloud computing is seen by business owners something of benefit as it eliminates the requirement for users to plan ahead for provisioning. A well as allowing enterprises to start slowly and increase resources only when there is a rise in service demand.</p>
								<p>You may not see it but cloud computing is everywhere. Netflix relies on cloud computing services to run its video streaming services and its other business systems too. Another great example is Gmail, where the consumer service allows large enterprises to host all their data and run all of their applications in the cloud. Cloud has been around since the early 2000s yet it has now recently been implemented as something of importance, caused by the rise of corporate data centers where companies store huge amounts of data  </p>
								<p>According to Gartner, global spending on cloud services will reach $260bn this year up from $219.6bn. It's also growing at a faster rate than the analysts expected. But it's not entirely clear how much of that demand is coming from businesses that actually want to move to the cloud and how much is being created by vendors who now only offer cloud versions of their products. In 2021 there will be a reshuffling of the top three public cloud providers, China's Alibaba Cloud displacing Google Cloud to take the third spot for revenue in the global public cloud market. Leading Amazon Web Services at number 1 and Microsoft at second. The future of cloud computing shows an increase of storage capacity where businesses who are adopting this technology predict that cloud providers like AWS will provide more data centres at lower prices. With the help of the Internet of Things, the quality of the internet can be increased. The cloud computing market is growing at 22.8 percent and will exceed $127.5 after 2018. By 2018, 62% of all CRM software will be cloud-based. Moreover, 30% of all application spending is for software as a service-based application.</p>
							<h3><b>What is the likely impact?</b><h3>
								<p>Cloud computing is considered important enablers for productivity and better services. Cloud has a positive impact on the business organization as it increases revenue and helps them to achieve end business goals. This is due to factors such as it being low cost, unlimited scalability, flexible in deploying service and better mobility. All these factors are what is making cloud being used widely today. The key is the increase amount of rapid data collection which is then used for analysis to better meet customer needs. 'The ride-hailing company Uber has stressed the importance of its hybrid cloud model to ensure not just constant uptime, but an indivisible relationship between product development and deployment. Uber is able to model a virtual fleet of taxis from private cars through a combination of mobile software, large-scale data analysis, mapping, and social networking.' The future of cloud will provide great benefits to both customers and businesses. ‘The global cloud computing market is expected to reach $623.3 billion by 2023. According to cloud computing growth stats, the industry will grow at a CAGR of 18%. Last year – in 2018, the market size was valued at $272 billion.’ From this we can see that this is steady market only willing to grow in the future. It is expected that cloud computing will affect IT jobs most strongly in the next 5-10 years. The adoption of cloud computing will migrate IT positions rather than eliminate them. As you move from inhouse computing to cloud, in other words the jobs will transitions, people would need grow their skills within the cloud sector such as consume the cloud providers services skills such as AWS or Google Cloud. These providers manage their own cloud.</p>
		
		
							<h3><b>How will this affect me?</b><h3>
								<p>With the ability to deliver high demand services including storage and processing power, cloud is being used all around us in our daily lives. When sending your friend, a photo over WhatsApp, the image is stored in a cloud. In terms of personal storage., cloud has enabled users to store files on a server where they are able to access them even remotely. Even if you would ever want to send someone a large file. Cloud is the way to go. Cloud is also playing a great part in Healthcare. Being able to manage patient data and sharing it amongst different medical professionals is helping society gain the most out the service. An example of how cloud computing is being implemented in our society is 'how IBM has used its Smart Cloud for Social Business to connect medical workers from around the world in a program to improve healthcare in Haiti (see IBM Expands Global Cloud Capabilities with Advanced Smart Cloud Services and New Customer Adoption).' When trying to watch a movie on Netflix, that’s you using the cloud, when wanting to listen to a song on Spotify you are using the cloud. Cloud is enabling users to become more aware of security. As everything is slowly shifting online, people are putting out tons of personal information and heavily rely on the security of the cloud to manage their data. “Cloud is about how you do computing, not where you do computing.” - Paul Maritz, CEO of VMware. Cloud is playing a critical role in our lives, hoping to help businesses as well as society around us</p>
			

							<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Robots: Trang</h3>
							<h3><b>What does it do?</b><h3>
								<p>Robots are man-made machines, performing labor work for humans either automatically or remote control. Robots carry out monotonous tasks and a majority of them are used today to perform activities in industries where work is hazardous to humans. Due to their ability to produce more accurate and high-quality work compared to humans, robots are continuing to steal human occupations.</p>
								<p>Today, the field of robotics is rapidly changing and evolving as the robot population increases quickly. It has been found that 2.7 million robots are already working all around the world according to the world Robotics 2020 Industrial Robots report. The most well-known user of robots is the manufacturing industry where robots test and assemble products, such as cars and industrial equipment. However, robots are now not only used for industrial purposes but to "mop the floor, flip burgers and for acting as an emotional support for lonely people". More human-like robots take on a more humanoid persona than industrial robots as they are designed to interact with humans. When it comes to the most innovative human-like robots that have been developed, Japan and South Korea are currently winning. These robots are used to entertain, act as a guide, and more. For example, such as the robot HRP-4C from Japan that was designed to look like a typical Japanese woman, can sing and dance for observers. With how far the robotic field has come, it is possible that in the future robots will have the ability to feel and show emotions and think like humans.</p>
								<p>In the healthcare industry, robots assist in surgeries, dispenses medication, disinfect rooms and monitor patient vital statistics, and alert nurses when a patient needs assistance. Recently, there has been a rise in robots being employed by pharmaceutical companies to speed up the fight against COVID-19. Robots have become very useful for fighting the virus since they don’t get sick and can easily get disinfected. Their role is to monitor patients, sanitize hospitals, make deliveries, and help frontline medical workers reduce exposure to the virus. With the rise of covid robots, medical works and health care assistants are less at risk of getting the virus.</p>
								<p>While robots are very useful tools to mankind, there are also negative impacts on human employment. Increase in robot employment results in an increase in human unemployment rates. This is because human labor will no longer be necessary for factories and manufacturing plants. According to The World Economic Forum, “Currently, approximately 30% of all tasks are done by machines—and people do the rest. However, by the year 2025, it's believed that the balance will dramatically change to a 50-50 combination of humans and machines”. It will only be a few more years until we see the immense impact it will have on individuals.</p>
							<h3><b>What is the likely impact?</b><h3>
								<p>Robots replacing humans in industries will positively impact humans by promoting the welfare of workers and raise our living standards, and benefits businesses by reducing wasted time and money while increasing productivity. Although it has been found that robots have greater negative impacts on human employment than positive as they affect wages and human employment through the displacement effect. Robots mostly affect medium and low-class workers especially people working at places that consist of physical labor in a predictable environment including fast-food restaurants, factory assembly lines, and basic data processing, like tracking payroll accounting. ‘These typically include unskilled or low-skilled activities’, the 2015 PwC report states. Roles that require creative thinking, emotional intelligence, and intuition that humans possess are believed to be safe from getting replaced by robots. </p>
								<p>Those that will be losing their jobs to robots will have to be retrained as it has been predicted that “more than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs”, according to an IBM survey.</p>
								<p>Although, some people think that this creates new jobs, like Marcus Casy and Sarah Nzau in their blog titled, “Robots Kill Jobs, but create jobs too” believes “the development of technologies that facilitate new tasks, for which humans are better suited, could potentially lead to a much better future for workers.” Moreover, only a few jobs are complete of tasks that are susceptible to automation, and thus, if machines carry out doing the tasks they are good at, this will provide employment opportunities for humans in those jobs by shifting their time to duties that they are uniquely good.</p>
								<p>Robots in the future will work with humans for jobs that require both routine tasks and engaging in cognitively complex and abstract tasks.</p>
							<h3><b>How will this affect me?</b><h3>
								<p>Our daily lives are affected by robots, including the cars we drive, the computers we use to search on google and send emails. As we already know robots affect human labor since they are cheaper to hire and can carry out tasks faster. Robots affect men slightly more than women mostly in manufacturing occupations such as machinists, assemblers, material handlers, and welders. As for women, the impacts of robots are found in non-manufacturing jobs. In the future, jobs that no longer need human labor will be completely replaced by robots. “When those jobs disappear, those workers go and take other jobs from lower-wage workers. It has a negative effect, and demand goes down for some of the retail jobs and other service jobs”, MIT professor Daron Acemoglu said in the recently published paper, “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from U.S Labor Markets”. This does not mean that robots will be taking all of our jobs because, for those jobs that are complex, robots don’t have a brain and can’t think like humans. </p>
								<p>It has been found that robots negatively affect workers at all education levels, however, workers that did not have a college degree were found to be impacted more than those that had a college degree. Researchers also found that workers that had a master’s or advanced degree do not have a positive impact due to the adoption of robots, unlike other technology.</p>
								<p>Robots also have been found to affect human relationships. Due to self check out and self-order machines that are becoming commonly seen in restaurants, fast food, and grocery stores, people do not have to interact with each other. </p>
								<p>Now that there are digital assistants we can talk to on our devices, some people are concerned that friendships and deep human connections will change and will be inhibited if we grow to comfortably talk to our devices. This may gradually make humans more disconnected from each other. There have also been concerns from parents worried that their children will grow up to be rude to people due to observing their interactions with digital assistances such as Alexa and Siri.</p>
