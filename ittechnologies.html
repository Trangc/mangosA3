							<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Machine Learning: Lam Zhi Wei</h3>
							<br><b><u>What does it do?</u></b>
							<p>Machine learning is a method in which machines automate decision making and create predictions through data analysis. (SAS, n.d.; Heath, 2020) </p>
							<p>With the increasing storage size and lower cost of data storage in the modern era, it is now possible to store as much data as possible, consisting of several types and categories. The ever-growing development of data storage allows machines to learn using large amounts of data, aiming to create a certain accuracy in the machine’s predictions to prevent unwanted risks. (SAS, n.d.) </p>
							<p>Machine learning is applied within the society in many ways that require risk assessments and accurate insights from a large database. In healthcare, patient data is analyzed for a faster and more accurate diagnosis. Professionals could use machine learning to identify health risks and make predictions for future heart attack, allowing for action against fatal heart attacks. In the marketing scene, companies can gain insight on customer needs for better advertisement and product recommendations. Companies could also find frauds and identify at risk profiles, the same for governments where machine learning is used to identify identity frauds. (SAS, n.d.) </p>
							<p>Despite the benefits weighting over the risks, machine learning still has plenty of flaws that professionals are trying to solve. Such flaws include biased data checking, error prevention, and increasing the accuracy of machine decision making within human interest. Because of the nature of machine learning, a potential bias in the data could cause a major error in accuracy, causing errors in predictions and decision making by the machine. Moreover, machines do not have the same moral principle and interests as humans do, thus, decisions made through machine learning may not be in the best interest of its creator if not programmed otherwise. Although some experts believe that machines can be taught morality, others do not. (proviti, n.d.) Regardless, with the future in mind, it is likely that these developments may happen, creating a society where AI (Artificial Intelligence) is to replace human labor with increased efficiency and accuracy.</p>
							<br>The current most recent development -- deep learning -- is a new learning branch where the machine is to learn through a layered network like the human neural network. This development involves having neurons represented as layers that check a part of a data individually before handing it to the next layer to produce a result or conclusion. This method has proven itself to be effective, as it could recognize scenarios better than humans could, and could even be used to identify cancer cell indicators and tumor indicators in MRI (medical research institutes). (Copeland, 2016) A more notable achievement of this new method, however, was its ability to analyze and predict climate change data. (ScienceDaily, 2020) With the issue of climate change surging within modern society, this recent breakthrough of being able to help in renewable studies allows for faster and more accurate completion, affecting society’s energy resource management, transportation, and agriculture without needing much data storage and computing resources.
							<h3><b>What is the likely impact?</b><h3>
							<p>Machine learning is a highly valuable and beneficial tool to the productivity of society, impacting several fields such as healthcare, finance, and governmental affairs. Society would be able to form better solutions to otherwise unsolvable problems, and businesses could crater consumers even more, allowing for better customization and personalization and thus, better economics. Governments will be able to detect crime more accurately and make better management decisions, while research in health and services would advance faster, better, and even more efficiently.</p>
							<p>Although not all jobs will be diminished because of it, there will be fewer and fewer job opportunities for individuals who are not specialized in artificial intelligent or computer related fields. It will, as shown in the current era, replace redundant jobs that are currently active. For example, marketing teams may not be needed anymore since machine learning is able to detect what is best for their customers, and nurses will no longer need to help doctors analyze and gather patient data, as machine learning could do it even more accurately than them.</p>
							<p>The current discussion on whether the data held for machine learning should be handed by an entity or not, has raised a potential impact in the development of data transparency and security. (proviti, n.d.) The discussion speaks of how if the data is held by one entity such as the government, the machine could be manipulated to only benefit the entity itself but not others, while if it is held by everyone, the trust and privacy between corporate deals and their customers would no longer exist. </p>
							<h3><b>How will this affect me?</b><h3>
								<p>For me, it will perhaps be beneficial because I study in the IT field. Although there is no guarantee that I will encounter anything related to machine learning, there is a high chance that I would have to learn how to develop machine learning as well for the company I would work for in the future. What will be very different for me in the future, however, would be the speed of how everything is processed, and how fast service is expected. Currently, education and work are forced to meet demands with adequate speed and efficiency. With how much faster society would be in the future, humans, or workers would have to work way more to make up to the time machines could. Despite initially stating that it would be beneficial for me, I was referring to when I get a job. With this line of thought, it would be much more difficult to find jobs for me if I cannot prove myself to be a better, and more efficient choice between other candidates for a job.</p>
								<p>Daily life wise, it would allow me to go through my day faster, reducing as much redundant and unnecessary work I have. I would also get better services, serving my needs better and solving any issues I have in a short period of time. This should apply to my family members and friends as well.</p>

							<h3 style="color:CadetBlue;">Cybersecurity: Nashita Baig</h3>
							<h3><b>What does it do?</b><h3>
								<p>Cybersecurity is a specialized field in the Information Technology industry which is aimed at protecting systems such as networks, servers, devices and data from cyber threats. The cyber threats can range from thefts, illegal activity, information disclosure, data leaks and other attacks which negatively affect and disrupt the service or software. These attacks can be done in a bid to access valuable information such as personal data, steal money or make a political opinion and can vary in different ways. In the pandemic period alone, cybercrime has climbed up 600% and there is an attack every 39 seconds which demonstrates the extent of the issue. Cybersecurity is itself a large field and can take of many forms and is often difficult to maintain with the new malwares and viruses created and being applied in unexpected ways. Every year, we become more dependent on technology and are shifting into a technological era where simple tasks such as transactions and services are taken online which makes us more prone to having cyberattacks. Cybersecurity having started and explored in the early 1970s aims to protect the technology we interact with by building technologies that defend against the attacks by thinking and acting in line of the hacker themselves.</p>
								<p>To combat threats in the field of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence is rising in prominence with businesses and corporations relying on authentication to make sure there are no threats, the artificial intelligence is also able to deep learn certain data to filter out and identify certain threats. Behavioral analytics is also being used especially in social media formats to help identify patterns which can detect attacks. There is also technology unveiled to defend physical devices called embedded hardware authentication which are small chips or other hardware better than software-based which makes it difficult for hackers or malware to attach themselves. Block chain security is another method on the rise which is a chain of digital blocks of data (such as a transaction), the data is encrypted and is difficult to change and hack into as the data is stored collectively together and in order to change one block all the other links should be altered making it difficult to hack without notifying services. Finally the last cybersecurity practice is called the Zero-trust Model which means that the system or the service is already hacked and under threat when the network/system is shared, it causes companies and corporations to have a clear view of data flow and control of the data to protect from internal and external threats. This results in everyone have an identifiable verification login when accessing the sensitive information to ensure there is no threats from either those who are trusted and those who aren’t. </p>
								<p>The scope of cybersecurity is constantly growing with the demand of security services rising in a bid to defend against cyber-attacks. In 2021 alone the world is expected to have a cyber threat every 11 seconds (Germain, 2021), major corporations and businesses are said to increase their security with incorporating AI, machine learning, embedded hardware authentication, blockchain and the zero-trust model. In the next couple of years specifically we can see biometrics, AI and the convergence of 5G networks come together to tackle the issue of cybercrime. Inventions and breakthroughs such as intel’s sixth-generation v-pro chips make cybersecurity possible which uses multi factor authentication to make sure hardware is safe and protected. It uses Bluetooth and user control to verify an individual and also uses a scrambled keyboard to help make sure passwords are not copied. The future of the intel chips also lies in “logical location” (Hachman, 2016) which relies on trusted WIFI networks being connected to the device. These new software’s and hardware’s ensure that the prospect of security will be advanced in the future.</p>
							<h3><b>What is the likely impact?</b><h3>
								<p>Cybersecurity will positively affect the global scale with many job offerings being opened to hire cybersecurity specialists and experts. By 2029, 31% of cybersecurity jobs will grow which ensures the stability of the industry especially as the new technological era takes over. The significance of cyber security is highly noticed now where companies and big corporations investing in cybersecurity to stop them from being vulnerable to hackers. Over the course of the years, we will see major companies aim to provide security to other small industries with the cybersecurity department becoming a business. </p>
								<p>Cybersecurity will be further explored and invested upon as new coming of the age malwares and viruses simultaneously will be released to threaten the technological ecosystem. Cybersecurity is likely to impact the society with more people being aware of the dangers of putting personal information online and leaving digital footprints which can cater the way of attacks, this would make people take measures to ensure their information isn’t compromised such as investing in new technology. If cybersecurity is not acted on and developed further major companies will see consumer loss as people will be reluctant to trust them, followed by large economic costs which can disrupt services around the world. Further with cybercrime increasing there is a possibility that online freedom will be restricted with governments and corporations fighting against crimes.  </p>
						
							<h3><b>How will this affect me?</b><h3>
								<p>With the risks of being cyber attacked, I will be conscious of my digital footprint online in the future, I would want to educate my family and friends of the dangers of cybercrime and how we are all equally susceptible to the doings of criminals online. I would want more funds to be funded in the field of cybersecurity for the experts and professionals to research and design/create innovations that will help me and my family be safe from any kind of threats. Cyber security will make certain platforms safer to use and sequentially I would be more comfortable using those apps. It is incredibly easy to put things up on social media without realizing certain stuff may be the gateway to an attack, for example there have been many fake instances where people disguise themselves as another individual and try to secure security questions which risks sensitive information.</p>
								<p>An aspect to how cybersecurity will specifically affect me is that I would like to look further into cybersecurity as a job prospect as it is becoming a stable domain in the IT industry. Further, cybersecurity will change how I view the world now, everything is in risk of getting compromised and it is incredibly easy for someone to access my information just by joining a public WIFI network. Especially with the development of other technologies such as robots, it is interesting to know how easy a robot can be hacked over a cellular network which would make me uncertain to trust certain AI developments. But with the high development of Cybersecurity, I would be more relaxed to trust these developments in my daily life and it would also make me safer on the internet and on different platforms.</p>
