							<br><b><u>What does it do?</u></b>
							<p>Machine learning is a method in which machines automate decision making and create predictions through data analysis. (SAS, n.d.; Heath, 2020) </p>
							<p>With the increasing storage size and lower cost of data storage in the modern era, it is now possible to store as much data as possible, consisting of several types and categories. The ever-growing development of data storage allows machines to learn using large amounts of data, aiming to create a certain accuracy in the machine’s predictions to prevent unwanted risks. (SAS, n.d.) </p>
							<p>Machine learning is applied within the society in many ways that require risk assessments and accurate insights from a large database. In healthcare, patient data is analyzed for a faster and more accurate diagnosis. Professionals could use machine learning to identify health risks and make predictions for future heart attack, allowing for action against fatal heart attacks. In the marketing scene, companies can gain insight on customer needs for better advertisement and product recommendations. Companies could also find frauds and identify at risk profiles, the same for governments where machine learning is used to identify identity frauds. (SAS, n.d.) </p>
							<p>Despite the benefits weighting over the risks, machine learning still has plenty of flaws that professionals are trying to solve. Such flaws include biased data checking, error prevention, and increasing the accuracy of machine decision making within human interest. Because of the nature of machine learning, a potential bias in the data could cause a major error in accuracy, causing errors in predictions and decision making by the machine. Moreover, machines do not have the same moral principle and interests as humans do, thus, decisions made through machine learning may not be in the best interest of its creator if not programmed otherwise. Although some experts believe that machines can be taught morality, others do not. (proviti, n.d.) Regardless, with the future in mind, it is likely that these developments may happen, creating a society where AI (Artificial Intelligence) is to replace human labor with increased efficiency and accuracy.</p>
							<br>The current most recent development -- deep learning -- is a new learning branch where the machine is to learn through a layered network like the human neural network. This development involves having neurons represented as layers that check a part of a data individually before handing it to the next layer to produce a result or conclusion. This method has proven itself to be effective, as it could recognize scenarios better than humans could, and could even be used to identify cancer cell indicators and tumor indicators in MRI (medical research institutes). (Copeland, 2016) A more notable achievement of this new method, however, was its ability to analyze and predict climate change data. (ScienceDaily, 2020) With the issue of climate change surging within modern society, this recent breakthrough of being able to help in renewable studies allows for faster and more accurate completion, affecting society’s energy resource management, transportation, and agriculture without needing much data storage and computing resources.
							<h3><b>What is the likely impact?</b><h3>
								<p>Machine learning is a highly valuable and beneficial tool to the productivity of society, impacting several fields such as healthcare, finance, and governmental affairs. Society would be able to form better solutions to otherwise unsolvable problems, and businesses could crater consumers even more, allowing for better customization and personalization and thus, better economics. Governments will be able to detect crime more accurately and make better management decisions, while research in health and services would advance faster, better, and even more efficiently.</p>
								<p>Although not all jobs will be diminished because of it, there will be fewer and fewer job opportunities for individuals who are not specialized in artificial intelligent or computer related fields. It will, as shown in the current era, replace redundant jobs that are currently active. For example, marketing teams may not be needed anymore since machine learning is able to detect what is best for their customers, and nurses will no longer need to help doctors analyze and gather patient data, as machine learning could do it even more accurately than them.</p>
								<p>The current discussion on whether the data held for machine learning should be handed by an entity or not, has raised a potential impact in the development of data transparency and security. (proviti, n.d.) The discussion speaks of how if the data is held by one entity such as the government, the machine could be manipulated to only benefit the entity itself but not others, while if it is held by everyone, the trust and privacy between corporate deals and their customers would no longer exist. </p>
