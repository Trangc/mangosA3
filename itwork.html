							<p><b>TRANSCRIPT:</b><p/> 
							<p><b>Trang: hAs part of an assignment for an introductory subject in our IT degree, we would like to interview you in order to get some idea of the day-to-day work in the IT industry. We are grateful that you would spare up to 30 minutes of your valuable time to speak with us about this. Your responses will be used as input to our assignment report.</b> </p>
							<p>Zhi Wei: Please tell us about the industry you work in, what job, your position, and what do you do in general. </p>
							<p>Yikang: my position in the IT industry is transformational consultant. Basically I transform traditional business into a more IT orientated business model.</p>
							<p>Trang:In your field of IT what kind of projects do you undertake and are you currently specialized in a specific area? </p>
							<p>Yikang: I specialize in automation so I undertake those projects that transform a company’s traditional ways of working by automating it using RPA which is robotic process automation or even machine learning and IA. I also specialize in helping more humans to free their time to do more meaningful things than repetitive things. But this year I'm moving into cloud migration whereby I will be helping more companies to move their IT process and architecture from physical location to cloud. </p>
							<p>Zhi Wei: What made you specialize in your specific IT field... as in why you decided to specialize in this field? </p>
							<p>Yikang: There is no specific location... I mean there's no specific reason. It just comes. It’s like suddenly I’ve read about this article about automation. Previously I did a lot of marketing automation then I think “ah this might be the future!” We might end up becoming like the terminator movie where everyone gets controlled by Skynet. So, I’d rather build robots rather than be controlled by robots.</p>
							<p>Trang: Can you give us an insight into a specific project that you have finished working on? </p>
							<p>Yikang: I have deployed more than 1000 robots in one of the biggest telcos in Thailand to free more than 1000 women full time jobs so they can do more meaningful jobs.</p>
							<p>Zhi Wei: How is your daily work life, where do you work most of the time? Are you always situated on the computer, or do you go out often to meet clients or attend meetings? </p>
							<p>Yikang: My daily work life is not very disciplined. I wake up whenever I want depending on the schedule. I do not meet clients everyday unless they request. Most of the time I’ll be commuting between my house... if I feel like working to office, I’ll work at office. If I feel like working at home then I’ll work at my home, if I feel like going to Starbucks or some café I’ll just go there and sit. Basically, working in the IT there's no location site on it, all those kinds of things. It’s like Call of Duty, whenever a client asks you, you just go to their place. Whenever a boss asks you, you just go to the office. Whenever you’re lazy and you don’t feel like doing anything you just sleep at home... yeah, that’s all.</p>
							<p>Trang: Who are the main people you are interacting with in your job line? For example, are they other IT professionals? Clients and customers? </p>
							<p>Yikang:Because my position is transformation consultant, internally I interact with sales team and our presales engineering team. Together we reach the clients which are mostly CTO which is also an IT profession. We also engage with the people sponsoring the project which is mainly CEOs and CFOs. Sometimes we engage with their transformation team or CoE (Center of excellence)  team. </p>
							<p>Zhi Wei: How do you effectively manage your time and work output?</p>
							<p>Yikang: In IT you don’t effectively manage your time. There are incidents and cases whereby you need to wake up at 2am or something, or there are sometimes when there is not much stuff to do... not much projects to implement... no incidents where you can sleep at home for one week. So, I can only say that effectively I’ll be... Let’s say the whole working day, the 8-hour workday. I’ll be standing by for incidents or project implementation doing my project if there is project for around 70 percent of the time, but I’m not the one implementing the project, I’m just managing the team. So, another 20 to 30 percent of the time I would need to learn some new technology that keeping update with the industry’s latest technology... checking courses to learn new tech, or even taking up exam for certification. To say 70 to 30... 70 is learning and 30 is doing the job.</p>
							<p>Trang: What kind of opportunities are present in the IT field? Do you get to travel anywhere? </p>
							<p>Yikang: Due to covid I am homebound. Pre-covid, I travelled around Thailand, then we receive projects from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia. Because we are working on consulting agencies we are able to travel. If you are working in IT you can't...Internally working for a company like Telcos, I don't think you have much chance to travel. </p>
							<p>Zhi Wei: What is the most challenging aspect of your job and how do you overcome it? </p>
							<p>Yikang:The most challenging thing is learning. It’s like a repeating process. It’s like going over and over again. For example, last year I just took an exam on google cloud. And this year they’re shifting. The market is shifting to Microsoft azure cloud. So, I need to retake all the exam and certifications again. This is the most challenging part. How do I overcome it... Theres no special recipe to overcome it. Just sit down and learn it. When you feel bored or anything just play some games or walk out at around 15 minutes then come back and sit and grind it again. That’s all.</p>
							<p>Trang:What is the best thing about your job? </p>
							<p>Yikang: I wake at 11 or 12, sometimes 3pm. </p>
							<p>Zhi Wei: Lastly, where do you see yourself in five years, taking in the fact that the IT industry is stable and significantly growing? </p>
							<p>Yikang: I am trying to build some side projects where in 5 years' time, I hope to see myself to come up with my own subscription-based application. I’m building something to help the e-commers industry. That’s where I see myself.</p>
