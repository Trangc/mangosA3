							<br><i><u>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</i></u>
							<br>My specific IT skills include being fluent in JAVA and another language such as Python, the job listing for someone with the
							specific JAVA skill is ranked 2nd in the IT burning glass skill list with around 2946 listings.
							Python is quite low on the listing and could be because Python is generally easier to learn than other languages.

							<br><i><u>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</i></u>
							<br>For my specific ideal job, the employer has outlined that communication skills is highly regarded as the job involves the
								individual to work with a team to achieve the required tasks, according to the burning glass data the active selection for
								 communication skills is the highest with it in demand at 44367 listings. Problem solving skills ranks at second to communication
								 skills which tells me these skills are highly important for my ideal job.

							<br><i><u>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</i></u>
							<br>The three highest lT skills not included in my listing: SQL, JavaScript and Microsoft Windows

							<br><i><u>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</i></u>
							<br>The three highest general skills not included in my listing: Organizational skills, Writing, Troubleshooting.

							<br><i><u>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i></u>
							<br>My opinion has not changed as a Java developer/software engineer is high in demand and it means it would be easier for me to
							find a range of jobs which are like my ideal jobs which have similar IT and generic skills. I found the burning glass data interesting
							 as these trends can help someone find an IT job where people know what's in demand and can put it in their resume.

							 <h2 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Sarah Khan</h2>
							 <br><i><u>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</i></u>
							 <br>My IT specific skills in my required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers falls between couple of categories,
							 building relationships comes 8th in the top IT Skills list with 2119 listings, as well as Python which is 22nd in the list.

							 <br><i><u>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</i></u>
							 <br>The demand from employers portrays that having communication skills is vital and, in most demand, this is since employees
							 must work as a team to complete set tasks under strict timelines. In comparison to my required skills for my job I would need to
							 focus on the accepts of problem solving and communication as these are ranked highest in the list with listings of up to 44k for
							 communication skills proving that these once again are vital to my job, while team building, and collaboration are further down the list

							 	<br><i><u>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</i></u>

							 	<br><i><u>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i></u>
								<br>Overall, I do believe my opinion on my ideal job has changed, I had found cloud an interesting side of IT but I think in the future
								I might prefer something more customer focused, even something more business directed. Becoming a project manager is also something I have
								taken into consideration. Both business management and project management fall under the top 10 skills in demand so I do believe this is something achievable.

							 <h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Lam Zhi Wei</h3>

							 <br><i><u>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</i></u>

								<br><i><u>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i></u>
								<br>A little. I was thinking of going into jobs relating to database more than software engineer. I wanted to at least learn something
								high up on the demand list to ensure I at least have a job in the future, thus, having the skills as written as the top in the IT skills section, SQL, I would prefer to become a database analyst
								or engineer instead. Of course, I could still pursue the current one because Java and JavaScript is still in high demand.
